Hii! This would be written in file if my program works.
This particular line is written using FileWriter


This Paragraph is written using PrintWriter class
It takes printWriter as input in constructor and has print and println functions


This para is written via BufferedReader class
This class also provides extra methods but i will be using PrintWriter more
